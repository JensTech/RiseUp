READ ME FOR EXERCISE/HEALTH APP

one thing that I need to keep in mind with this is the organization. Ideally I would like the app to have the following functions
- List of Workouts to be done during that time
- Meal plan.
- 2 Calorie trackers
    - Burned...i.e. on garmin watch
    - Consumed from Food found in Meal Plan.
- Starting Weight and Strength levels
- How much lost (weight) and how much gained in your lifting abilities.
- functions of a garmin watch.
- personal bests i.e. lifitng and running
